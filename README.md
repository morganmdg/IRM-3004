**High-level Feature Status Overview:**

Completed:

- Integration of the database with LittleReads home page:
Users now have access to the sign-in/sign-up pages,
and their interactions are recorded in the database for data storage purposes.
- Sign-in functionality enabling users to access books and bibliographic information:
Users can securely log in to their accounts and access book details and
bibliographic information stored in the database.

Pending:

- Development of Home Page: Backend integration for sign-in is complete;
now working on finalizing HTML/CSS components for a comprehensive user experience overview.
- Development of Explore Page: The explore page,
designed for users to browse and discover books based on various criteria, is not yet fully developed.
Although a skeleton page exists, there are ongoing challenges with integrating frontend and backend code.
This integration is vital for enabling effective book exploration and discovery.
- Development of Description Page: The description page,
acting as a centralized location for book descriptions upon user selection, has not been fully developed yet.
This delay is attributed to complications in pulling backend information, specifically related to the linter.
This page plays a crucial role in providing detailed information about selected books.
- Functional implementation of 'My Shelf' Page:
The 'my shelf' feature, allowing users to save and organize their favorite books, is still under development.
Challenges persist in integrating frontend and backend components.
This feature enhances the user experience by offering a personalized reading list.
- Complete integration of frontend and backend code: While progress has been made in some areas,
the full integration of frontend and backend code remains ongoing.
This integration is essential for ensuring the platform's overall functionality.

Cancelled:

- Due to workload management considerations, LittleReads Inc. has decided to discontinue the development of the
'friends' and 'challenges' features.
This decision aims to allocate resources more efficiently and prioritize essential project elements.
