Team 6 - LittleReads Inc.

**Description of Application** - LittleReads is an online platform for kids aged 8 to 12, helping them discover and review books. It's designed to make reading fun and engaging, with personalized book recommendations based on their age and interests. Parents, teachers, and librarians can also join in to encourage reading together. We measure success by how many kids sign up, share reviews, and interact with the platform, as well as revenue from ads.

**High-level Feature Status Overview:** 


**Done:**
- Integration of database with LittleReads home page: Users can now access the sign-in/sign-up pages features, and their actions are recorded in the database, allowing for user data storage.
- Sign-in functionality allowing users to access books and bibliographic information: Users can log in securely to access their accounts and view book details and bibliographic information stored from the database.

**Not Yet Done:**
- Development of Home Page: The home page, acting as the primary landing page for users, is ongoing. While integration with the back-end code, particularly for sign-in functionality, has been achieved, the focus now shifts to completing the HTML/CSS components. Finalizing this page is crucial to offer users a comprehensive overview of the platform's features and content.
- Development of Explore Page: The explore page, designed for users to browse and discover books based on various criteria, is not yet fully developed. While a skeleton page has been created, there are ongoing issues with integrating front-end and back-end code. This integration is crucial for enabling users to explore and find books tailored to their interests effectively.
- Development of Description Page: The description page, which serves as a centralized location for the descriptions of each book upon selection by the user, has not been fully developed yet. The reason being, our information from the backend hasn't yet been pulled due to complications, specifically with the linter. This page is crucial for providing detailed information about selected books.
- Functional implementation of 'My Shelf' Page: The 'my shelf' feature, which allows users to save and organize their favorite books, has not been fully implemented yet. Again, due to on going complications with the front and back end integration. This feature enhances user experience by providing a personalized reading list.
- Complete integration of front and backend code: Ultimately, while some integration has been done, the full integration of front-end and back-end code is still in progress. This integration is essential for ensuring the functionality the platform.

**Cancelled:**
- In order to prioritize workload effectively, LittleReads Inc. has opted to discontinue the development of the 'friends' and 'challenges' features. This decision was made to allocate resources more efficiently and concentrate on essential project elements.
